# Weather Forecasting-App using HTML CSS And JAVASCRIPTS.

This is a weather app which shows you weather of each and every state.
It show you the weather of the city, temperature , description , humidity and wind .And it also have a cute weather gif with a quick note .

I have made this by fetching API , with the help of these it show you the full description of weather of the city you search.

I also took an efforts on making good UI.
